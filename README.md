# Final-Project
This is my Final Project for Drawing on the Web!

For this project, I created a scene inspired by Super Paper Mario. 
It includes elements from various games in the series. 
The main function, in which you click the floating man or floating Luigi,
causes the scene to rotate, showing a different perspective. 
This was a main feature of the gameplay in Super Paper Mario.
